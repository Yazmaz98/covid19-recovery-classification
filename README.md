# covid19-recovery-classification
This paper aims at studying the chances that a patient diagnosed with Covid19 has to recover from this illness. It is a classification problem (target variable is a response “Survived” 0 or 1).

Can we know whether a patient will recover, based on age, gender, country and whether the person comes from or has visited Wuhan in the past? We will calculate their recovery chances (probability) using logistic regression to then classify using a threshold.
